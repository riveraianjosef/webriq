They do not offer WYSIWYG,previewing on demo sites may take an update cycle, they are often based on markdown text files, and they require some knowledge of modern day repositories.</p>\n<p>Moreover, when teams are collaborating, it can get complicated quickly. Has this article already been proof-read or reviewed? Is this input valid? Are user permissions available, e.g. for administering adding and removing team members? Can this article be published at a future date? How can a large repository of content be categorized,organized, and searched? All these requirements have previously been more or less solved within the admin area of your CMS. But of course with all the baggage that made you leave the appserver-app-database-in-one-big-blob stack in the first place.</p>\n<h2><strong>Content API is one solution</strong></h2>\n<p>Decoupling the content management aspect from the web building system. And then replacing the maintenance prone server with a cloud based web service offering. Effectively, instead of your CMS ,you move to a <a href=\"https://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/content-as-a-service/\">Content Management as a Service (CMaaS)</a> world, with a content API to deliver all your content. That way, you get the all the <a href=\"http://www.digett.com/blog/01/16/2014/pairing-static-websites-cms\">benefits of content management features</a> while still being able to embrace the static site generator mantra.</p>\n<p>Systems like Prismic or Contentful are typically designed to be fast, scalable, secure, offer high uptime, so that you don’t have to worry about maintenance ever again.\nSeparates content from presentation, so you can reuse your content repository for any device platform your heart desires. That way, you can COPE (“create once, publish everywhere”).\nOffers webhooks that you can use to rebuild your static site in a fully automated fashion every time your content is modified.</p>\n<p>On the not so positive site, the platforms are proprietary (as opposed to open source), do not come cheap, have a lot of complexity that more often not needed then needed and have a relatively high cost of ownership.</p>\n<h2><strong>A better alternative is a <a href=\"http://app.webriq.com/auth/register\">FREE CMS</a> for your static website</strong></h2>\n<p>Deploy modern static websites with our automated open source platform.
