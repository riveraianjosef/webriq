Your website has just gone viral. Thousands of visitors are pouring in to learn about your company, and possibly become customers. Before long though, most of your visitors are greeted with one of these:</p>\n<p><strong>INTERNAL SERVER ERROR 500</strong></p>\n<p><strong>BAD GATEWAY – 502 ERROR</strong></p>\n<p>Your server is down, and so is your website.</p>\n<p>But there’s another way. A way to have a website that never goes down. A website that quietly maintains itself, is safe and secure, and remains unchanged as it goes from 100 visitors a month to 100 visitors a minute.</p>\n<p>The idea of a single server serving traffic for a website harks back toan age of mainframes and ISDN lines. But the demands of scale and perfect uptime killed the mainframe. Maybe it’s time they killed single-server sites as well.</p>\n<p>A server is a complicated piece of equipment. It needs to be updated. Any of the two hundred processes running on it has the power to cripple the machine. It will stubbornly refuse to serve more requests than it can handle. It will shutdown in the middle of the night, or the middle of your vacation.</p>\n<p>Your homepage and marketing pages shouldn’t need to connect to a database. If your marketing site is opening a database connection just to render, you have a very finite limit on how many requests you can serve.</p>\n<p><strong>Think of the browser as your new server.</strong> You get a brand new shiny one dedicated to every user who visits your site. It can make requests. It can make decisions. It can show what you want when you want. But unlike an actual server, it can interact with the user instantly, show helpful feedback, and look great. It can do more than simply display what your web server spits out.</p>\n<p>So lose your web server. Host your site by uploading some HTML and JavaScript to the cloud, and let it be served to your users from a content delivery network with servers around the world. Upload yourfiles manually, use a static site host like <a href=\"http://www.app.webriq.com/auth/register\">WebriQ</a>, or an <a href=\"https://github.com/EagerIO/Stout\">open-sourcetool</a>.</p>\n<p>Nothing can compare to the simplicity of knowing your site can handle all the traffic in the world and still remain fast and reliable. That it can’t go down, because there’s nothing you’re responsible for which can stop working. It’s fundamentally so much simpler, and simpler things are better.</p>\n<p>Better meaning easier to build. Easier to debug. Easier to change and improve. Easier to keep running in the face of whatever life is going to throw at your business. Oh, and it’s faster for your users, it can not be hacked, and never has to be updated, unless it needs change.</p>\n<h3><strong>Try it out on <a href=\"http://demo.webriq.com/\">DEMO</a> and <a href=\"http://demo.webriq.com/admin\">ADMIN</a> your site with user name <a href=\"mailto:demo@webriq.com\">demo@webriq.com</a> and password demo!@#1234</strong></h3>\n<p>Static websites are the future.\nIf you want some neat APPS that can enhance your Static website, check out <a href=\"http://eager.io\">EAGER</a></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">    </code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"title":"Building Static Websites","date":"April 23, 2016"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/building-static-websites/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/why-using-a-static-website/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Why using a Static Website"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/issues-with-static-website-generators/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Issues with Static Website generators"}}}}}
