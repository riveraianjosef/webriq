In addition, the syntax is rendered while editing to clearly show the expected result. Headings are larger, emphasized words are italicized, links are underlined, etc.\nWYSIWYG editors that produce HTML are often complex and buggy. Markdown solves this problem in many ways, plus Markdown can be rendered natively on more platforms than HTML. However, Markdown is not a syntax that an average user will be familiar with, nor is it visually clear while editing. In other words, for an unfamiliar user, the syntax they write will make little sense until they click the preview button.\nThe SimpleMDE implementation on our CMS system has been designed to bridge this gap for non-technical users who are less familiar with or just learning Markdown syntax.\n<img src=\"http://phpwebfactories.myresponsive.website//uploads/site_phpwebfactories/pages/Untitled.png\"></p>\n<h1>Features of the new markdown editor</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Autosaving – after two minutes of being idle on your browser, your work will be auto saved as a draft article or post</li>\n<li>Spellchecker – spelling mistakes are highlighted</li>\n<li>Mobile friendly – a bit difficult to write on a smartphone, but writing and updating your posts through a tablet is surely do-able</li>\n<li>Multiple preview modes – markdown only, preview only and split markdown/preview </li>\n<li>markdown guide </li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Other CMS enhancements</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Draft articles or posts – all drafts wether it is a new post or a change in an existing post can be saved at all time.
