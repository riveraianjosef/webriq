About 40,000 blogs are believed to have been hit.\nThe vulnerability had set off a “feeding frenzy” among hacker groups, WordFence founder Mark Maunder told the Bleeping Computer tech news site.\n“During the past 48 hours we have seen over 800,000 attacks exploiting this specific vulnerability across the WordPress sites we monitor,” he added.\nSucuri said some hacker groups had moved on from defacement to attempts to use the bug to hijack sites for their own ends.\n“Attackers are starting to think of ways to monetise this vulnerability,” wrote Sucuri founder Daniel Cid. “Defacements don’t offer economic returns, so that will likely die soon.”\nHackers were keen to use the vulnerable sites as proxies for spam or malware campaigns, he said.","position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":17,"column":97,"offset":1876}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":2,"column":1,"offset":1},"end":{"line":17,"column":97,"offset":1876}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"With the rapid evolution of websites being build on Static website generators, and hosted on CDN networks versus servers, the whole issue of hacking and security fixes should go away altogether.
