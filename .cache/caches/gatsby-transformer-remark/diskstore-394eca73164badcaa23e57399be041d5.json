But as technology shifted away from desktop and page-centric browsing to become more mobile, the CMS started to suffer from technical debt.\nOne way of trying to solve the problem, is adding an API to a monolithic CMS. This is a band-aid repair. The quick fix does nothing to repair the fundamental problem, which is the enormous underlying technical complexity of a CMS initially designed for a past area.
