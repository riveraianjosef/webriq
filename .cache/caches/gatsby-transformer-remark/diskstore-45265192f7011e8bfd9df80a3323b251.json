They are called legacy because they have been around for quite a while, are build on old(er) technology stacks. In the last 5 years, the traditional CMS landscape has not evolved much - both CMS technologies as well market maturity remains unchanged. There is hardly any innovation from traditional CMS vendors. Although some vendors have added support for APIs and cloud services most have not even bothered to adapt with changing technology landscape. Case-in-point, most enterprise CMS vendors lack robust full-site content delivery network (CDN) integration. In fact, CDN support is often limited to static assets not realizing that with the arrival of HTTP2 domain sharding is a thing of past. \nWhen it comes to innovation, most of CMS solutions are constrained by their legacy architecture (read strong coupling between content management and content presentation) which makes it difficult to serve content to new types of emerging channels such as apps and devices. API support is critical for innovation but it needs to be a first-class citizen and not afterthought. In addition, traditional CMS solutions lack integration with modern software stack, cloud services, and software delivery pipelines. Possibility to apply continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) concepts with a traditional CMS is mostly unheard-of. At the core, a traditional CMS is a monoliath.

API is a pretty generic term and goes beyond the world of CMSs and the World Wide Web.\nMost Headless CMS systems will expose their content through a REST API. REST APIs can be great for simple data structures but tend to get tedious and time-consuming to use when your content models are more complex. It’s also a more laborious exercise to change or fit these APIs for different uses.\nFacebook developed the API standard GraphQL as a response to the less flexible REST convention. GraphQL lets you query the API with the fields and relationships you need for each occasion, almost like what you can do directly with a database.

Now a day there are so many options - Amazon CloudFront, Cloudflare, Google CDN, Azure CDN, Edgecast, Fastly, and the list goes on. Gone the days when you required to have big fat-contract with Akamai. With most of CDN services, you can start small and pay as you go. Having a CDN in front of origin (static site or APIs) reduces the global and regional latency. This is achieved by caching content (static HTML page, assets, APIs) at a large number of geographically distributed edge locations. In addition, CDNs scale really well - we are talking about 5-10k concurrent requests without any issues. To protect origin server from request overload some CDNs also support origin shield - an additional caching layer between edge and origin servers. Typically, this mid-tier caching is a designate edge or pop location closer to your origin server and other edge servers query origin shield rather than origin directly.\nHosting companies like Netlify refer to their CDN infrastructure as Application Delivery Network (ADN), which has no distinction between edge and origin servers. This is primarily to support the atomic deploy model and instant cache invalidation so that there is no risk of stale content or inconsistent state. With ADN, switching between multiple version of a static site is as easy as changing symlink to a directory. Atomic deploy model can be extended to advanced functionalities such as staging, instant rollbacks, phased rollouts, and A/B testing. Many conventional CDNs are unable to support some of these features due to restrictions and limitations around the instant cache purge. For example, some CDNs rate limit the cache invalidation, while others charge for each cache invalidation request.","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1,"offset":4676},"end":{"line":19,"column":805,"offset":6441},"indent":[1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1,"offset":4676},"end":{"line":19,"column":805,"offset":6441},"indent":[1]}},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What can you expect from WebriQ GLUE","position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":4,"offset":6446},"end":{"line":21,"column":40,"offset":6482},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":21,"column":1,"offset":6443},"end":{"line":21,"column":40,"offset":6482},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"We have been designing and developing websites and web apps for a long time, and we have seen all the deficiencies of project based pricing, per hour pricing, unknowns in devops, unknowns in maintenance, overruns, delays etc.\nWe have developed a very opinionated way of implementing websites, ecommerce carts and webapps and we completely moved away from a monolithic, legacy and centralized approach.
