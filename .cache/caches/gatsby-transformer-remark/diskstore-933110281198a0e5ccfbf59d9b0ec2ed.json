But as it turns out, the solution had already been created. In fact, it had been created even before CMSs like Joomla and WordPress had been invented! The answer is static websites, which are not generated by software on a server. Let’s break it down. with something like WordPress, the CMS is acting as the intermediary between the server and the user; when you visit a WP site, the browser requests the page, WordPress pulls the information, such as text, images and whatnot from its database, then uses predefined layouts from themes, plugins etc…to generate workable webpage from all that information that is then sent to the browser.\nIn a static website, either the page is manually created, or generated using static-page-generation-tools. Either way, since the actual generation is done in advance, when your browser sends a request to the website’s server, the only thing the server needs to do is send the pre-generated files to the browser, rather than running through the entire fetch-generate-send process.\nThis approach offers some pretty major benefits that directly answer the issues discussed earlier. For one, a static website hugely increases wetite security; many hacking attempts take advantage of exploits that allow them to ‘inject’ their own code into the CMS’ or website’s code, but in order to do this there needs to be actual code being run. In a static website everything is, as the name implies, static; no code is being run, only the generated website files are sent to the browser, making the site nigh-impossible to hack without gaining direct access to the server.\nSecondly, since a static website doesn’t demand any additional operations to be run by a server, such as compressing PHP code or connecting to a database, to generate the final content it allows for significant improvement in load speed and optimization.

For example, it can link with an API, pull in your data, and render parts of it into your views on compile. Then it can render the same or other views as javascript templates and you can push any other data from your API into them on the fly at runtime on the client side in reaction to user actions. And that’s just a small taste of its capabilities.
