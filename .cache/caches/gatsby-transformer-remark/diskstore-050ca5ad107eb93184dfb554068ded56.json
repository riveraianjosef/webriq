Either the server answers the page immediately, exactly as it is stored, or the server generates it by executing code on demand.\nAlthough the Web was conceived as an entanglement of static files, server-side programming languages appeared very early and are now widely used. More than 80% of servers that use server-side language are running PHP. And hosting providers offering servers without dynamic language support are almost non-existent.\nYet, the dynamic generation of HTTP responses presents significant disadvantages in terms of web performance. A dynamic webpage is often built around a web server that loads an execution language that analyzes the HTTP request, often requests a database (sometimes located on another server in the datacenter) and third-party services, populates a logical model that reveals itself through an aggregate of templates to generate the HTML response. Quite logically so, response time is longer.\nA paradigm shift\nIf you want to deliver your static pages, you must have compiled them up front. This fact, as trivial as it may seem, changes everything. Indeed, compilation turns out to be the main advantage of static: shift the complexity from the Production environment to the integration process.\nIf your pages are served by a web server without being generated first, you have no need for a server-side language to be executed. As a consequence, many attack vectors disappear. You can’t steal confidential data by injecting malicious code if you have neither a database nor a server-side execution language.\nThe static trend allows you to completely transform the way a site is published.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":22},"end":{"line":10,"column":81,"offset":1751}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":22},"end":{"line":10,"column":81,"offset":1751}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"How does the Jamstack work","position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":4,"offset":1756},"end":{"line":12,"column":30,"offset":1782}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":12,"column":1,"offset":1753},"end":{"line":12,"column":30,"offset":1782}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"A static site generator (SSG) is a software executed locally or as a service that produces (and sometimes deploys) a static website using some data sources for model and configuration, and templates containing the business logic.\nThe SSG market is booming.
