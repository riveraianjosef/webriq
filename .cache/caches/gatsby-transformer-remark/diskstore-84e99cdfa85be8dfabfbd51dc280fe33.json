Much like “Progressive Web Applications,” which was another set of guidelines but not a library, JAMstack isn’t any one set of code. Rather, it’s an approach to solving problems.</p>\n<p>That is a big distinction versus, say, Node.js, which is a library. JAMstack can involve any number of different technologies or methodologies and still be within the realm of what the concept encompasses.</p>\n<h2>One Size Doesn’t Fit All</h2>\n<p>JAMstack may sound amazing, and in many ways, it is a groundbreaking new way of looking at web development, content delivery, and web hosting, but it doesn’t fit for all scenarios.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, the best way to know for sure is to undergo a thoughtful, comprehensive discovery process to get a sense of how your website or application should be built. It could be that your site would benefit from the current norm, such as a monolithic system. Or perhaps JAMstack is, in fact, right up your alley.</p>\n<p>Technology choices should always be made based on business requirements, not what’s hot at the moment. Developers are way too often skewed toward always recommending the hottest and trendiest platforms and methods. Always offset those opinions with your own due diligence and the advice of an expert practitioner who is not married to any one approach.</p>\n<h2>Tendency to move away from monolithic CMS Systems</h2>\n<p>Drupal , WordPress and SquarSpace are  traditionally “monolithic” CMSs, with presentation baked in via the theme. However, due to the need for more flexibility and freedom, many companies have begun decoupling the CMS, using it for content management, editorial, and administrative tools, while implementing a separate frontend component that communicates with the CMS via API.\nDecoupled CMS architecture (aka “headless”) is rising in popularity in the development world. This model allows breakthrough user experiences, gives developers great flexibility to innovate, and helps site owners future-proof their builds by allowing them to refresh the design without re-implementing the whole CMS. With all this upside, it’s no wonder this type of build has gained serious traction in the business community as of late.</p>\n<h1>Digital Trends in Business</h1>\n<h2>We now live in a multichannel world</h2>\n<p>51.3% of people now spend more time searching the Internet on mobiles than on desktops.\nUS Consumers use on average 3.5 connected devices each.\nAugmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) market will grow from $5.2b in 2016 to more than $162b in 2020.</p>\n<h2>We need a new way of managing content in this multichannel world</h2>\n<p>We’ve been using traditional web-oriented CMS systems for years. But the new multichannel era requires a different approach to managing content.\nIn the new multichannel world, your content may be consumed on any number of devices. If you do not want to miss the opportunity of truly engaging with your customers,\nyou need to make sure your content is ready for multiple channels. This requires a whole new mindset in structuring, organizing, managing, and presenting content.</p>\n<h2>Microservices</h2>\n<p>Microservices represent one of the major shifts in software architecture. Today’s systems are increasingly built as a combination of both internal\nand external services connected via their API.\nIn the past, companies used to build websites on top of monolithic CMS platforms which meant they were locked in with a single vendor.\nWhen they decided to change their CMS, they had to throw away their investment and start pretty much from scratch.\nThe new generation of CMS systems are built as “headless” or “API-first”, which means they can be easily integrated into any application, no matter\nwhat technology it uses.</p>\n<h1>WebriQ - JAM Stack GLUE</h1>\n<p>At WebriQ, we have been developing and deploying JAM Stack websites for over two years now. With a <a href=\"http://app.webriq.com\">dedicated APP</a>, we have been able to build, develop, update and manage hunderds of sites.\nIn this model we are using a Static Site Generator to develop the site, a GIT based CMS system to update the content and a Github repository to store all HTML, CSS and Javascript files. GIT files are pushed to a CDN network.\nWhereas this model does fit well for most smaller projects, it has it’s shortfalls when it comes to larger projects or projects with a need for frequent content updates and updates made by a variety of users, content writers and third party contributions </p>\n<p>Since the JAM Stack is more a concept then a real technology stack, we have been contemplating for a while how we could combine the best of the traditional LAMP Stack ideas and the serious advantages and benefits of the JAM Stack. It’s what I would call the GLUE of the JAM Stack.</p>\n<h1>What are we gluing together</h1>\n<p>A comprehensive Database (MongoDB) Service\n<a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com\">https://www.mongodb.com</a></p>\n<p>A Javascript (Node.js) API Content Management Framework\n<a href=\"https://strapi.io\">https://strapi.io</a></p>\n<p>A State of the Art Static Site Generator\n<a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">https://www.gatsbyjs.org</a></p>\n<p>An ultra-redundant global CDN\n<a href=\"https://www.netlify.com\">https://www.netlify.com</a></p>\n<h4>GET EARLY BIRD ACCESS TO<a href=\"http://madmarketing.webriq.services/f/3\"> WEBRIQ JAM STACK for ENTERPRISES</a></h4>"}
