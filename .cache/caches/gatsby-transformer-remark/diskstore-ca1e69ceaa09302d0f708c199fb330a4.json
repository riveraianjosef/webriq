You can “pre-bake” and pre-build assets and then serve them on Content Delivery Networks. This effectively frees your content from the database/templates imperatives of traditional CMS, like Wordpress and Drupal.\nHowever, the content itself still needs to live somewhere. That’s where Github comes in.\nTo create your site, you can use a static site generator like Spike, the one implemented as standard by WebriQ or a Javascript frameworks like Ember, Angular, React, or Vue. It doesn’t matter. The point is you store the site’s content in a GitHub repository, where most of your pages can be simple Markdown files.
