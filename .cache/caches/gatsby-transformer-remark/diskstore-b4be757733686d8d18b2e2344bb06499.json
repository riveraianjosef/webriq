The likes of Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal and a ton of others come to mind. Five to six years ago that seemed the way to - you store all your data in a relational database and you serve all the content from a web server. The dot’s are connected via a user interface to administer and manage all the content and users from of your web assets.\nTablets and smartphones were not around in large quantities, browser capabilities were minimal and security and speed were not high on the agenda.

Now all you have to do is actually create the content. Beyond that, quality SEO is really all about structure, structure that isplatform agnostic.
