What does that mean? Simply put, once you are done with the design and install the website it will only do what you asked it to.

It is second only to WordPress and with over 30 million downloads and now with WordPress integration, it’s no slouch.

An HTML page has absolutely no interactivity, and it only includes what you code. For example, if you code a Web page with an article, then that’s all you will get. There will be nothing else on the page except for that article. There will be no user content, no dynamic content that generates while you are away and the website will remain static. On the other hand, if you program it to include a database so that users can access information I guess in a sense you could call that a limited form of interactivity. The same holds true with a shopping cart. A user comes to your website purchase a product or service you offer; so in the same sense they can interact with your website in a limited form.","position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1,"offset":4569},"end":{"line":22,"column":835,"offset":5403},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":22,"column":1,"offset":4569},"end":{"line":22,"column":835,"offset":5403},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"If you want to make changes to your site like adding a new post (write a new article) or page you will need to create it first and then upload the HTML file it to your server and then change the navigation bar (menu) before it is visible to the user. This takes up a lot of time, especially if you add one or more pages a day. Another consideration is: if you don’t have a good CSS structure in place then changing parts of your website can be very cumbersome. For example, you want to change the background color for all of your pages on your site. If you have the background color programmed with CSS and have it called out in the HTML for all of the pages, then changing the color in the CSS will change the color on all of the pages on your website. This is huge for website that might have 100 pages or more, otherwise you’ll need to change all 100 pages individually. As you can see, static HTML sites are easy for the guy who understands the code requirements, but not so for that person little to no code knowledge. Finally, SEO! You will need to code all of the SEO into your static website yourself.
