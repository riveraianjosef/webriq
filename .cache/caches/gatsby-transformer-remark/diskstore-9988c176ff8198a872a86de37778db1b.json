When the world was just web and email, a web CMS could handle dynamic content delivery just fine. These systems, which date back to the 1990s from vendors like Adobe, Drupal, Wordpress amongst others grew by solving tough problems like unique designs, WYSIWYG authoring, workflow for approvals and translation, marketing support, and Internet-scale delivery.

In a monolithic, desktop and web only environment that is (rather was) the optimal solution. In a mobile, Internet of things, ecommerce environment the coupling of templates and content becomes a burden, that grows heavier with the day. API’s are an afterthought to these systems, and even if these systems have build API’s on top of their legacy systems, they still reflect the tightly coupled approach. There is no easy or simple way to pull out content natively and dynamically at runtime and re purpose the content in other non-HTML environments. And the content sits in Search Query Language (SQL) databases as opposed to the more agile and flexible non-SQL (such as MongoDB or MariaDB).

It uses modern storage, stateless interfaces, and cloud infrastructure to efficiently deliver Internet-scale content experiences on any device. The different components of the Stack are loosely coupled (GLUED) together via API’s. The content is stored in pure format, ready for any purpose. Stateless API’s are quite robust and even more robust with GraphQL. GraphQL queries access not just the properties of one resource but also smoothly follow references between them. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request. Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network connections.\nWith a headless content management system, you gain flexibility in your delivery tier. For example, you can pull the content from a separate web delivery tier like a Git repository and deliver that content to a CDN. Each time your repository content changes, a rebuild of the site will occur through continuous deployment.
